A personal project for reusing Anet A8 hardware in a more modern frame. This frame is an upside-down CoreXY design. The design goals are as follows:
1) Simplicity: Limit the number of unique parts, make them easy and fast to print
2) Iterability: The design will change alot as it progresses; make it easy to do so
3) Speed: Print speed should be limited by the extruder and steppers/drivers, not by frame design
